      <p>Look at yourself.  Soft and weak, hardly fit to call yourself a Fighter.  You spend too much time pushing sweet rolls into your mouth and not enough time sweating.</p>
      <p>Well, you're in luck, Butter-Roll.  The best cure for weakness is push ups...and we've got those in spades.</p>
      <p>[Supplement your practice with a daily quest to improve your conditioning and cut weight.  Take your time and split'em up however you need to.  The important thing is to get through them.] </p>
      <p>Guild Master Humongous:  Finished with the sweeping already? Good, I’ve got plenty more training that needs to get done.</p>
      <p>Guild Master Humongous:  What’s that? You say you don’t like my training methods?!</p>
      <p>Guild Master Humongous:  Hrm, I see you have some fair arguments... I tell you what, Butter-Roll. Organize them, prepare a little speech and I’ll gather everyone together here in the common room so you can tell it to the floor.</p>
      <p>You stare at him blankly.</p>
      <p>Guild Master Humongous:  Tell it to the floor! NOW!!</p>
