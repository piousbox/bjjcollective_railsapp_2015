# MongoSessionStore [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/brianhempel/mongo_session_store.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/brianhempel/mongo_session_store) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/mongo_session_store-rails4.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/mongo_session_store-rails4)

## Description

MongoSessionStore is a collection of Rails-compatible session stores for MongoMapper and Mongoid, but also included is a generic Mongo store that works with any (or no!) Mongo ODM.

MongoSessionStore is tested [on Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/brianhempel/mongo_session_store) against Ruby 1.9.3, 2.0.0, 2.1.5, 2.2.0, and JRuby with Rails 3.1 through 4.2.

Mongoid users: This gem is compatible with both Mongoid 3 and 4.

If this gem doesn't work for you, you might next try [mongo_sessions](https://github.com/biilmann/mongo_sessions).

See the [Changelog](#changelog) if you need support for an older version of Ruby, Rails, or Mongoid.

## Usage

MongoSessionStore is compatible with Rails 3.1 through 4.2.

In your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "mongo_mapper"
# or gem "mongoid"
# or gem "mongo"
gem "mongo_session_store-rails4"
# or gem "mongo_session_store-rails3"
```

In the session_store initializer (config/initializers/session_store.rb):

```ruby
# MongoMapper
MyApp::Application.config.session_store :mongo_mapper_store

# Mongoid
MyApp::Application.config.session_store :mongoid_store

# anything else
MyApp::Application.config.session_store :mongo_store
MongoStore::Session.database = Mongo::Client.new(['127.0.0.1:27017'], database: \"my_app_development\")
```

By default, the sessions will be stored in the "sessions" collection in MongoDB.  If you want to use a different collection, you can set that in the initializer:

```ruby
MongoSessionStore.collection_name = "client_sessions"
```

And if for some reason you want to query your sessions:

```ruby
# MongoMapper
MongoMapperStore::Session.where(:updated_at.gt => 2.days.ago)

# Mongoid
MongoidStore::Session.where(:updated_at.gt => 2.days.ago)

# Plain old Mongo
MongoStore::Session.where('updated_at' => { '$gt' => 2.days.ago })
```

## Changelog

6.0.0 supports the Mongo Ruby Driver 2.0 for the generic MongoStore. The other stores are unchanged. Tests added for Rails 4.2. Tests against MongoDB 3.0.1 on Travis CI.

5.1.0 generates a new session ID when a session is not found. Previously, when a session ID is provided in the request but the session was not found (because for example, it was removed from Mongo by a sweeper job) a new session with the provided ID would be created. This would cause a write error if two simultaneous requests both create a session with the same ID and both try to insert a new document with that ID.

5.0.1 suppresses a warning from Mongoid 4 when setting the _id field type to String.

5.0.0 introduces Rails 4.0 and 4.1 support and Mongoid 4 support alongside the existing Rails 3.1, 3.2, and Mongoid 3 support. Ruby 1.8.7 support is dropped. The database is no longer set automatically for the MongoStore when MongoMapper or Mongoid is present. You have to set the database manually whenever you choose to use the vanilla MongoStore.

The last version to support Ruby 1.8.7 is [version 4.1.1](https://rubygems.org/gems/mongo_session_store-rails3/versions/4.1.1).

The last version to support Rails 3.0 or Mongoid 2 is [version 3.0.6](https://rubygems.org/gems/mongo_session_store-rails3/versions/3.0.6).

## Development

To run all the tests:

    rake

To run the tests for a specific store (examples):

    rake test_31_mongo
    rake test_32_mongoid
    rake test_40_mongoid
    rake test_41_mongo_mapper

To see a list of all options for running tests, run

    rake -T
